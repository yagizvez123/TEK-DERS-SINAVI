Introduction
The purpose of this project is to implement a perceptron, a basic unit of artificial neural networks, and measure the time it takes for the perceptron to make a prediction for a given input. The perceptron is designed to mimic a logical gate, and its behavior is analyzed by observing the output for different inputs. The main objective is to gain practical experience in implementing and evaluating the performance of a perceptron.

Implementation Details
The implementation is done using the C programming language in Visual Studio Code. The code consists of a struct definition for the perceptron, functions to initialize the perceptron and make predictions, and the main function for execution. The perceptron is initialized with two inputs, specific weights (-0.400000 and -0.530000), and a threshold value of 0.250000. The predict function calculates the weighted sum of inputs, adds the threshold, and applies an activation function to produce the output. The main function initializes the perceptron, provides an input (1, 1), and measures the time taken for the perceptron to make a prediction using the clock() function.

Conclusion
This project successfully implemented a perceptron in C and measured the time taken for it to make a prediction for a given input. By observing the output for different inputs, it was determined that the perceptron mimics the behavior of a logical AND gate. The project provided practical experience in coding a perceptron, understanding its components, and evaluating its performance based on execution time. The gained knowledge can be extended to more complex neural networks and machine learning applications.
